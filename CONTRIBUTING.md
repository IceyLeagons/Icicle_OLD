## Introduction

Thanks for the consideration of helping with this project, we appreciate you taking your time to help, grow and improve Icicle.
In order to make this effective, we've made a guidline you shall follow.

## Ground rules

Before you make a contribution, please make sure it follows these ground rules:

### Ground rules for issues

* Make sure you're using the latest version, chances are that the problem has already been solved.
* Check if there's already an issue made (which is the same as yours) before you make another one.
* Don't post your issue in other issues, please keep everything nicely organized and make a separate one.
* Please keep the issues section for actual bugs or code problems, not for support. (Support should be handled in our Discord server)

### Ground rules for pull requests

* Make sure your pull request benefits all users, not just you.
* Make sure you're pull request hasn't already been made.
* If you're making a pull request regarding an issue, please link that issue as well.
* Check and fix any warnings/errors that your IDE has given you, before submitting the pull request. (This project does not throw errors on us in our IDEs, if it happens to you it's your IDE's issue.)

## First timers

If you want to help with this project, but don't know where to start, take a look at the
[currently opened issues](https://github.com/IceyLeagons/Icicle/issues). There may some people who could use your help.

## Experienced contributors

You may have seen, that we have a shiny Contributor role on our Discord. How can I get it? - you may ask.
This role isn't for everyone, it's specifically created for those that have high interest in helping our projects by submitting code, fixing bugs regurarly.
You should not ask for this role, this is our own decision, when we see you're worthy we'll give it to you. Harassing us with this may even worsen your chances of getting the role.

## Getting started with pull requests

When you want to fix an issue, make sure no one is assigned to that issue as of yet. If someone is assigned, (s)he will fix it. Also when you're more experienced with this project, please leave issues tagged with "good first issue" for people with less experience, unless there are no other issues available.

Note that issues tagged with "good first issue" don't necessarily mean this has to be your first issue. You can still fix those issues if you feel like you don't have that much experience with this project or aren't very comfortable with it.

When you want to fix an issue, please leave a comment stating that you're going to fix this issue so we can assign you to it. This ensures that people aren't wasting their time by fixing the same issue.

If your pull request is bigger than a few lines (say 10 max.) make a fork of the project and add the changes there first. Changes
that are smaller (documentation changes, spelling/grammar fixes, adding comments etc.) can be done directly without the need for a new fork.

## Submitting an issue

When submitting an issue, a template will be shown. Please don't discard this, but instead fill in the information asked for. There's
room at the bottom for additional info you'd like to include, in case needed. This template is for users submitting a bug. If you aren't
reporting a bug, but rather suggesting code improvements, pointing out spelling mistakes etc, you can ignore the template.
